            <p>
                The first UNESCO World Heritage site which features on this list is Berat. 
                It’s one of the best places to visit in Albania for its attractive architecture and the most beautiful cityscape.
                Berat’s hillside features stone houses which appear to be stacked on top of one another.
                 It’s known as the city of 1000 windows due to the symmetrical openings in each building.

             <a href="https://sq.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana" class="a2"> <p class="VENDE">TIRANA</p> </a>
            <p>The capital city is without a doubt one of the best places to visit in Albania. It simply can’t be missed. 
                A city nestled within mountains and hills, this modern and cosmopolitan city has so much to offer. 
                I’d recommend learning all about Tirana’s most famous attractions, 
                like the Et’hem Bey Mosque and Clock Tower, by taking a walking tour of the city.</p>

            <a href="https://albania.al/destinations/osumi-canyons/" class="a2"> <p class="VENDE">OSUMI CANYONS</p> </a>
           
            <p>A trip to the Osumi Canyons, or the ‘Grand Canyon’ of Albania, is not to be missed for adventurers.
                 The Osumi Canyon is the perfect place for white water rafting if you’re visiting Albania at the right time. 
                If you’re staying in Berat for a few days, make sure you visit.
                The best time to explore Osumi is in Spring. During these months, 
                the water level is high enough to explore the entire canyon by water.</p>

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjirokast%C3%ABr" class="a2"> <p class="VENDE">GJIROKASTRA</p> </a>
            <p>Gjirokaster is one of the most beautiful places in Albania. 
                An old Ottoman town which is so well preserved it’s designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 
                The city is dominated by the Gjirokaster Fortress which provides a fantastic view of the city, 
                the Gjere mountains, and the Drino River. The Fortress holds many historical artefacts 
                in the grounds and the on-site museum. This includes a US Air Force Jet which crash landed during WWII.</p>
